designing programs to be organized around data or objects
as programs get large and compliacted, shit can hit the fan real fast
    oop helps shit not the fan

self object refers to the object
    this is c++

example
    class Robot_Dog:

        def __init__(self, name, breed):
            self.name = name
            self.breed - breed

        def bark(self):
            print('woof')

    def main():
        myDog = Robot_Dog('Spot', 'Bulldog')
        print(myDof.name)
        my_dog.bark()
