Conditionals
    Help make decisions in python
    < <= == >= > !=
    Same as every other langauge
    use if keyword to evalulate conditionals
        if temp > 80:
            print("It's too damn hot")
    indented code is what's run when condition is true
    else keyword to run code if if statemet is false
        if temp > 80:
            print("It's too damn hot")
        else:
            print("Good weather")
    elif for additional conditionals
        if temp > 80:
            print("It's too damn hot")
        elif (temp < 50):
            print("It's cold")
        else:
            print("Good weather")
    or and and keywords can be used to combine conditioanls
        if temp > 80 or temp < 50:
            print ("stay inside")
        else:
            print("go outside")
