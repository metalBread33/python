designing programs to be organized around data or objects
as programs get large and compliacted, shit can hit the fan real fast
    oop helps shit not the fan

self object refers to the object
    this is c++

example
    class Robot_Dog:

        def __init__(self, name, breed):
            self.name = name
            self.breed - breed

        def bark(self):
            print('woof')

    def main():
        myDog = Robot_Dog('Spot', 'Bulldog')
        print(myDof.name)
        my_dog.bark()


Class inheritance
    is-a relationship
    a dog IS A animal
    derived class based on base class

    class Parent:
        def __init__(self):
            #code 
        def func1(self):
            #code
        
    class inherited(Parent):
        #code

    Can call any func from inherited or parent class
    by default uses parent init method
    if both have the same function, child class func runs by default 
        super() allows for parent class func to run
            super().func()
