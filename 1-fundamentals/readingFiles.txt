need to use full path to reach a file if file is not in the same path
if file is in the same dir as program, can use relative path

open function returns file object
with keyword makes sure file will be closed once its done 
    with open('file.txt') as file:
        #code
read() function returns whole file as string
readline() returns next line of file as string
readlines() returns list of string as list
    shortcut: loop over file
