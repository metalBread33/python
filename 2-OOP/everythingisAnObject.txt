need oop for handeling complex data
a class is essentially a new type that you create
attributes of an object contain all of the details
classes can have their own functions
    read and alter states to an object
objects have a __class__ attribute that shows what class they belong to
everything is an object in python
You should use oop when it makes since
    simple scripts are not a good idea to use oop
