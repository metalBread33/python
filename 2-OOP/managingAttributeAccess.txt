use getter and setters to access attributes instead of doing it directly

pillars of OOP:
    abstraction
        display basic info and hide implemetation
        user only needs to have the interface    
    encapsulation
        class instances should group related data and method
        hiding data attributes whch are only used for internal implementation purposes
access modifiers can be used to prevent users from doing things they aren't supposed to
    python doesn't have things
    start non-publuc by using _ at the beginning
        users can still access attributes
name mangaling: start attribute name with __ 
    messes with name when outside of class; harder for user to access

python supports properties
    use class decarator
        @property
    essential a read only data attribute
