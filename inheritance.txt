inheritance helps with DRY
    reusing shared data between classes
    base class --> derived class
functions and attributes passed

base class in () when defining derived class
    class Base:
        #blah blah blah

    class Derived (Base):
        #blah blah blah

even if derived is empty, objects made with derived class inherit all of base class functionality
to call base class functiuon in derived clas, prefix func call with super
    super().func()

can override methods in derived class

polymorphism --> one thing can take on many forms
